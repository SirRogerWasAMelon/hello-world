## Practising, aka flailing about in the dark

I am trying to learn some coding. I don't know what I'm going to use it for, so I'm not sure which languages to learn. It seems worthwhile to learn stuff, though. Coding is being taught in primary schools now, so it seems like I should know the basics. Languages I have heard of that seem like they would be helpful:

- Java
- JavaScript
- Python

To wit, I am working my way through the Khan Academy (KA) introductory courses. So far I'm partway through html and CSS.

Which brings me here, a place where I can ostensibly set up a website, to test-run the things Im learning at KA.
